Game idea: Titanium Storm

  Titanium Storm will be a turn-based tactics game that plays similar to X-Com and fire Emblem, in a futuristic setting where humans are fighting robots and machines.
  
  The game's playing area will be a top-down grid where the player's units can move and take cover behind walls, and shoot at enemies (with hit chances dependent on weapon, distance and cover, and damage based on weapon with slight random variation). Enemies will have simple pathfinding AI to patrol the area, move toward the player's units, and stay in cover. 
  
  The online components will include a level editor where players can create and upload levels, and play and rate levels made by other players. There will also be leaderboards for each level, so players can compare scores with each other or compete for the best score. Depending on how the project is going, multiplayer gameplay might be a high target goal.
  
  Key users should be players and level editors. Players should want to command units and fight enemies. Level editors should want to make levels with a user-friendly interface and upload them for the players to play.
  
  An example of gameplay - A player looks at the database of levels and finds a level made by someone else with many plays and a high rating. The player begins the level and commands his units to move into cover. The robots move into cover and shoot the player's soldiers with a 65% chance to hit but they miss. On the player's next turn he commands his units to shoot the robots and hits them, winning the level. He gets the high score, which is saved to the level database, and he rates the level with a. Another player looks at the leaderboards for this level and tries to beat the first player's score.
  
  Gameplay principles include "gameplay over graphics" and "small engaging levels over long campaigns".
